## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I had a very good understanding between "min-width and max-width"

where functions min-width media query is active at screen pixel and above

and max-width active at screen pixel set and below



### Useful resources
